                <p class="flex-child">Hi! My name is Adam Olson. I live in the greater Milwaukee area with my fiance√©, two cats, and
                    a bunch of frying pans. Classically, I'm a chef. I've been working in the food industry for the past 6 years,
                    and have had a passion for cooking all the same since I was younger than I can remember.

                    with what makes computers tick. Out of high school, I interned with a small software company that
                    built programs for health insurance companies, specifially in the SQL department. Thinking
                    back on my enjoyment of that process (years later) lead me to apply to the UW Extended campus Full Stack
                    program. Now I'm learning the basics of HTML and CSS, which
